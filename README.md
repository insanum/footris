A Tetris clone for the [Android Hacked app coding game](http://www.hackedapp.com/).

The Hacked app is both awesome and a royal pain in the ass. The story mode is
very good and fun for all levels of programmers. The sandbox mode is a
different beast. The editor is terrible and with larger programs the
cut-n-paste/move functionality stops working and you're retyping code
constantly just to move it between code blocks. If the editor was more freeform
the experience would be a ton better. Also you can't save your own code to the
sdcard. It sure would have been nice to edit my Hacked code using Vim under Termux
and then reload in the app. I can't complain too much though... I spent many
hours in this app and had a great time. Check it out!
